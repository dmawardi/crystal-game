Monash Web App Dev Bootcamp Week 4 Homework: Crystal Counter Game

#### Goal: 
build a Crystal Counter game: User must achieve an exact integer by clicking on the crystals, which have been assigned random invisible values.

#### Solution:
JQuery and 'data-' attributes were used to select elements, build event handlers and assign values to clicked gems.  As the user clicks, a counter will keep a sum of the current value and the user is aiming to reach the 'target' value.  

#### Scoring:
If the user goes over the value, they have lost the round. If the user achieves the value exactly, they win the round.
